# Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the Thoughtful AI Challenge. It involves creating a robust web scraping application that extracts news data based on user-defined parameters. The application is built using Python and Selenium, ensuring high resiliency and compliance with best practices in automated web interactions.

## Features

	•	Dynamic Web Scraping: Configurable to extract news based on search phrases, categories, or the age of the articles.
	•	Data Extraction: Collects various details such as titles, dates, descriptions, and images from news articles.
	•	Parameterized Execution: Utilizes Robocorp’s cloud platform to process input parameters through work items.
	•	Error Handling: Implements advanced error management strategies to handle and log exceptions gracefully.
	•	Output Formatting: Stores the scraped data in an Excel file, with detailed logging of operations.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Selenium WebDriver
	•	ChromeDriver (matching the version of your Chrome browser)
	•	Additional Python libraries listed in requirements.txt

### Setup

	1.	Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/marcmacedo/thoughtful-ai-challenge.git
  cd thoughtful-ai-challenge
  ```
 
  2. Install Dependencies
  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  3. Configure the application:
	  Set up environment variables or modify the config.json file with necessary parameters such as chromedriver type, path directories, or other configuration settings.
    OBS. This project was developed on an ARM SOC architecture, so there are two chromedrivers in drivers directory, one for local testing (_arm) and the other for RoboCloud environment.
  
### Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:
  ```bash
  python src/main.py
  ```
If you are running locally, don't forget to fix your queries in src/main.py. See the example below:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
  search_phrase = 'Sprots'
  months = 2
  main(search_phrase, months)
```

## Deployment

	The application can be deployed on Robocorp’s cloud environment for regular, automated runs. Follow the setup instructions in the Robocorp documentation to configure your cloud environment.

Built With

	•	Python: Primary programming language.
	•	Selenium: Used for automating web browser interaction.
	•	Robocorp Cloud: Used for deploying and managing the automation scripts.

# Template: Python - Minimal

This template leverages the new [Python framework](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp), the [libraries](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp/blob/master/docs/README.md#python-libraries) from to same project as well.

The template provides you with the basic structure of a Python project: logging out of the box and controlling your tasks without fiddling with the base Python stuff. The environment contains the most used libraries, so you do not have to start thinking about those right away. 

Other templates are available as well via our tooling and on our [Portal](https://robocorp.com/portal/tag/template)

## Running

#### VS Code
1. Get [Robocorp Code](https://robocorp.com/docs/developer-tools/visual-studio-code/extension-features) -extension for VS Code.
1. You'll get an easy-to-use side panel and powerful command-palette commands for running, debugging, code completion, docs, etc.

#### Command line
1. [Get RCC](https://github.com/robocorp/rcc?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started)
1. Use the command: `rcc run`

## Results

After running the bot, check out the `log.html` under the `output` -folder.

## Dependencies

We strongly recommend getting familiar with adding your dependencies in [conda.yaml](conda.yaml) to control your Python dependencies and the whole Python environment for your automation.

<details>
  <summary>"Why not just pip install...?"</summary>

Think of [conda.yaml](conda.yaml) as an equivalent of the requirements.txt, but much better. 👩‍💻 With `conda.yaml`, you are not just controlling your PyPI dependencies; you control the complete Python environment, which makes things repeatable and easy.

You will probably need to run your code on another machine quite soon, so by using `conda.yaml`:
- You can avoid `Works on my machine` -cases
- You do not need to manage Python installations on all the machines
- You can control exactly which version of Python your automation will run on 
  - You'll also control the pip version to avoid dep. resolution changes
- No need for venv, pyenv, ... tooling and knowledge sharing inside your team.
- Define dependencies in conda.yaml, let our tooling do the heavy lifting.
- You get all the content of [conda-forge](https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge) without any extra tooling

## What now?

Now, go get'em

Start writing Python and remember that the AI/LLM's out there are getting really good and creating Python code specifically.
